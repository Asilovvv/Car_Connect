4. Non-functional Requirements
4.1. Security
Protection of users' personal data using data encryption.
Security of authentication via JWT (JSON Web Token) or OAuth 2.0.
4.2. Performance
Response time to user requests should not exceed 1-2 seconds.
The platform should handle up to 10,000 users simultaneously.
4.3. Reliability
The platform should be available at least 99.9% of the time.
The system should save data in case of emergency failures via backup.
4.4. Scalability
The ability to easily add new features or increase the number of supported users.
5. System Architecture
Backend: Java Spring Boot with REST API for interaction with the client.
Frontend: React or Angular for creating a dynamic user interface.
Database: PostgreSQL for storing user, car and transaction data.
Payment systems: Integration with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal).
Hosting: Hosting the server on a cloud platform (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud).
6. Development Plan
Requirements collection: 1-2 weeks.
Architecture design: 1 week.
Backend development: 4-5 weeks.
Frontend development: 4-5 weeks.
Integration with payment systems: 1 week.
Testing and debugging: 2 weeks.
Project launch: 1 week.
7. Testing
Functionality testing: checking the operation of all modules (search, booking, registration).
Security testing: checking for SQL injections, XSS attacks and data leaks.
Load testing: checking performance with a large number of users.
8. Scope
The platform will be useful for both tourists and locals who need to rent a car for a certain period. CarConnect can also become a valuable tool for small businesses engaged in car rental.

9. Risks and solutions
Risk: Problems with the payment system.

Solution: Implementation of alternative payment methods (bank transfers, cards).

Risk: Low user activity at the start.

Solution: Conducting marketing campaigns, discounts and promotions to attract the first users.

10. Additional
The project will be implemented taking into account the possibility of expansion. Possibilities of introducing new functions such as truck and motorcycle rentals or providing short-term insurance services for rented cars will be taken into account.

This project aims to improve the car rental process, creating a safe and convenient platform for all market participants.
